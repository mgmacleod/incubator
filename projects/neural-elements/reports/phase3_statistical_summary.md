## Key Statistical Findings

### 1. Sigmoid Collapse Confirmed

At depth 5, sigmoid achieves only **53.6%** accuracy,
which is near random chance (50%).

### 2. Sine Excels on Hard Tasks

On spirals (the hardest dataset), sine achieves **83.0%**
at depth 5, with 95% CI [80.7%, 85.3%].

### 3. XOR is Solved

23 configurations achieve 100% accuracy on XOR:
- GEL depth 1
- GEL depth 2
- GEL depth 3
- GEL depth 4
- LEA depth 1
- ... and 18 more
