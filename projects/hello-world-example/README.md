## Status
Archived (Example Project)

## Description
This is a simple example project to demonstrate how to structure projects in the incubator. It's a basic "Hello World" program that shows the recommended project layout and documentation style.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

## Goals
- ✅ Demonstrate basic project structure
- ✅ Show how to document a project
- ✅ Provide a simple, working example

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

### Running
```bash
cd projects/hello-world-example
python src/hello.py
```

Expected output:
```
Hello from the Project Incubator!
This is an example project to help you get started.

Key takeaways:
- Projects are self-contained in their own folders
- Each project has its own README.md
- Keep it simple and start experimenting!

Check the _template folder for a project template.

## Project Structure
```
hello-world-example/
├── README.md          # This file
└── src/
    └── hello.py       # Main program
```

## Current Status
This is a completed example project meant to serve as a reference. It demonstrates:
- Basic project folder structure
- Minimal but clear documentation
- A simple, runnable program

## Notes and Learnings
This example shows that incubator projects can be as simple or complex as needed. The key is to:
1. Have a clear README
2. Keep the project self-contained
3. Document what you're learning or building
