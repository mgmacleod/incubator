# Projects Directory

This directory contains all the experimental projects in the incubator.

## What Goes Here?

Each subdirectory in this folder is a separate experimental project. Projects can be:
- Proof of concepts
- Technology experiments
- Learning projects
- Early-stage prototypes
- Idea explorations

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Project

1. **Use the template**: Copy the `_template` folder to get started quickly:
   ```bash
   cp -r _template your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   # Edit the README.md with your project details
   ```

2. **Or start from scratch**: Create a new folder with at least a README.md:
   ```bash
   mkdir your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   # Create your README.md
   ```

### Browse Examples

- **`_template/`** - A template you can copy for new projects
- **`hello-world-example/`** - A simple example showing the basic structure

## Guidelines

- Each project is self-contained in its own folder
- Every project must have a README.md
- Keep projects independent (don't share code between projects)
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines

## Need Help?

- Check the `_template` folder for a starting point
- Look at `hello-world-example` for a simple reference
- Read the main [README.md](../README.md) for overall guidelines
- Open an issue if you have questions
